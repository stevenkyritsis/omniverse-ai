Installtion steps start with Dwnloading Omniverse launcher through https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim from there you cna sign up for an account and download the windows 
version or the docker version. 

I downloaded the windows version
then through the exchange tap in omniverse you can search up Isaac sim and download it along with the Isaac assets packs

You have to download the 3 packges and Once downloaded, 
combine the contents of each pack into a single root folder. 
For example, merge or copy the contents from assets pack 2 and 3 into the assets pack 1 folder .

You will copy from both isaac_sim-assets-2-2023.1.1 & isaac_sim-assets-2-2023.1.1. You should copy the Nvidia 
folder from each asset file to the first one. Make sure you're not replacing the file that you're actually combining them.

You can make sure that they were combined by checking the size of the asset folder after. 

Now after combining the 3 asset files you can move the create a new NVIDIA folder in the library in your nucleus server and drag drop the whole assets folder in the root of the asset package

this is how the layout of your server library should be after combining the assets

now you can use Isaac sim along with the additional assets for better User experince ![image](https://github.com/mahmoud25112/omniverse-ai/assets/148357408/a079cac1-800c-426a-b52c-1ce7802710a1)
